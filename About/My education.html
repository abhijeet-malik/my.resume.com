    <li>About the internship: Mr. Moses Karketta Sir, Senior Manager (Electrical),<br />
    NALCO Smelter Plant for his valuable guidance during the project.</li>
</ul>
<p>"Visiting & Study about Carbon Area": The present capacity of smelter is 4.60 lakh TPA.<br />Alumina is converted into primary aluminum through a smelting process by using electrolytic reduction.<br />
    From the pot-line, the molten aluminum is routed to either the casting units, where the aluminum can<br />
    be cast into ingots, sow ingots, tee ingots, billets, wire rods, cast strips and alloy ingots, or to RPU where<br />
    the molten aluminum is rolled into various cold-rolled products or cast into aluminum strips.</p>
